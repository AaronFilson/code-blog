Here is the assignment ver1:

Assignment for Class 1 - jQuery and the DOM
Welcome to your new blog!

You will create a static blog site, to represent your personal online presence.
Please use the included file: blogArticles.js, that adds an array of ready-to-use blog posts to a blog JS object (that you will have to create).
Add the .eslintrc config file to the root of your blog project repo.
User Stories

Let these user stories guide your development:

As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup, so that employers will love me.
As a reader, I want the blog to show most recent articles on top so that I can easily read the latest.
As a reader, I want relative timestamps to give me a idea of how many days ago something was written.
As an author, I want my name linked to my site, so that readers can learn more about me.
As a reader, I want the site to look reasonable, so that I can read it on any device.
Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

Use good Object Oriented code: Create a blog object, and a constructor function for articles.
Leave as little in the window (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
Create the markup for an example Article in the DOM, then use jQuery to clone that for each article.
Your Article prototype should have a .toHtml() function that adds new data to the DOM.
Add basic styles: a css reset, content in a single centered column, reasonable margins, etc.
Your blog should end up looking something like this. http://hijk.it/image/1l402M1Y0q3K/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-23%20at%2012.19.46%20PM.png

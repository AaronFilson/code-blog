Assignment for Class 12 - REST and APIs
Now that we understand how applications can handle different URLs, we can write code that communicates with other code.

User Stories: MVP

As a developer, I want to treat my GitHub repositories as a resource (with full MVC components), so that I can manage them within my blog.
As the site owner, I want to highlight certain repos on my /about page so that everyone can see the great projects I am working on.
User Stories: Stretch goals

As the site owner, I also want to show off other recent GitHub activity, so that everyone knows how active I am on GitHub. Get creative!
As the site owner, I want my lists of GitHub activity well designed, so visitors like looking at my page.
As a developer, I want people to be able to "watch" or "star" my repos with their own GitHub accounts, so that my repos get better numbers.
Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric

Ensure your code passes ESLint.
Place all code within the proper layer of abstraction and encapsulation.
Use an authenticated ajax call to GitHub's API to get your repos.
DO NOT publish your GitHub Token to any public repo.

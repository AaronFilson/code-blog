Here is the assignment ver5:
Now that you have a blog where your articles can be read, let's create a nice interface for writing new articles.

We'll use a special html page, not linked from the main page, that will allow you to write a new article, and export it into the JSON format that the blogging system supports.

This is a paired assignment

Work in pairs. Pick a driver and a navigator to start.
Add a new feature to the navigator's repo.
Switch off as each major feature is completed.
The new driver now implements the same feature on new navigator's repo.
Teach each other about what unique approaches you took in your own code base.
